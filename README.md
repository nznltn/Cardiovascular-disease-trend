This project analyzes cardiovascular disease (CVD) trends across European countries over multiple years. It explores mortality rates by disease type (e.g., ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease), age group, and gender. The data is sourced from Eurostat and aims to support insights into public health priorities, gender disparities, and regional differences in cardiovascular outcomes.
